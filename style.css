        <h2>JoJo's Wonderful Adventure is the legendary work of Japanese manga artist Araki Hirohiko. Known for its exciting and marvelous adventures and battle experiences. Starting with JoJo's Excellent Adventure Season 3: Stardust Crusaders, Araki has added an original and bold idea, the Stand (pronounced Sutando). Each Stand is a manifestation of the spiritual energy of its owner, the "Stand User", and the Stands, with their strange appearances and abilities, as well as a number of special mechanisms, would later become the centerpiece of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga.
            All photos and names on this page are from jojowiki, and currently include only the stand-ins for JoJo's protagonists and villains from JoJo Season 3 through Season 5.</h2>
